# Installing VTL Application

Specify the database connection settings in the configuration file
`config.php`. 
* [Configuring connection to SQLite](sqlite.md)
* [Configuring connection to PostgreSQL](pgsql.md)
* [Configuring connection to MySQL](mysql.md)

Upload the program files to a PHP-enabled web server.

Open the installation script `install.php` in browser (on the web server).

The script installs the program and displays two messages:

```
* Installing the program...
* Installation complete.
```

If there are no other messages, installation completed successfully.

`install.php` can be deleted after successful installation of the program.

Don't forget to change the administrator password.
